Displays the text in English on an image, using Tesseract-OCR API to process the image to text
- Users can upload the image from the local system and the text on the image will be displayed in a panel box in the same format as in the image.

### Assumptions and Limitations
- Reading the [Improve Quality](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/ImproveQuality) Wiki page for stated to work on ```Rescaling```,
```Binarisation```,```Noise Removal```,```Rotation/Deskewing```,```Border Removal```
- It fails if the text in the image is rotated upto certain extent and also when there are borders, i.e fails for border removal
- The accuracy of the text displayed becomes less if the font-size is less, and also if some new font-family is used.

### Accuracy and Adaptability
- Jimp image processing library is used to Rescale the image,converting to black and white, noise in image, rotation upto certain extent.
- The accuracy isn't 100%, but works fine with clear text on an image.
